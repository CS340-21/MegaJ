### Introduction
Our project is a mobile application that will be a recipe database. In the database, you will be able to put in your ingredients that you currently have in your fridge or pantry, and the app will tell you which recipes you can make. The motivation for the project is to take the stress out of the kitchen and reduce food waste.  
There are similar apps on the market: SuperCook and CookList. Ours would be very similar (input ingredients, suggest recipes, possibly include an expiration date feature). However, we would include a social aspect that would allow users to add their own recipes and share with others on the app. We would also provide the option for users to make their recipes public, allowing their personal creations to be added to the pool of recipes our app can choose from. All three of our team members are computer engineering majors, and have varying levels of experience working on mobile applications. We are all hoping to gain experience from our time working on this application.
